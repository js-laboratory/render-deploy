## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A Render account. If you don't have one, you can sign up at <https://render.com>.
- Basic knowledge of Git and command-line tools.
- Familiarity with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js.

## Deploying a JavaScript Service

In the `service-js` directory and `.github/workflows/service-js.yml` file, you'll find instructions on deploying a JavaScript backend service on Render.com. This example demonstrates how to deploy a `Fastify` server using JavaScript.

## Deploying a TypeScript Service

In the `service-ts` directory and `.github/workflows/service-ts.yml` file, you'll find instructions on deploying a TypeScript backend service on Render.com. This example demonstrates how to deploy a `Fastify` server using TypeScript.

## Deploying a Dockerized JavaScript App

Explore the `dockerized-js` directory and `.github/workflows/dockerized-js.yml` file to learn how to deploy a Dockerized JavaScript application on Render.com. The example includes a Dockerfile for containerization.

## Deploying a Dockerized TypeScript App

Explore the `dockerized-ts` directory and `.github/workflows/dockerized-ts.yml` file to learn how to deploy a Dockerized TypeScript application on Render.com. The example includes a Dockerfile for containerization.

## Deploying a Dockerized JavaScript and React.js App

Explore the `dockerized-react-js-app` directory and `.github/workflows/dockerized-react-js-app.yml` file to learn how to deploy a Dockerized JavaScript application with `React.js` on the frontend using Render.com. The example includes a Dockerfile for containerization.

## Deploying a Dockerized TypeScript and React.js App

Explore the `dockerized-react-ts-app` directory and `.github/workflows/dockerized-react-ts-app.yml` file to learn how to deploy a Dockerized TypeScript application with `React.js` on the frontend using Render.com. The example includes a Dockerfile for containerization.

## Deploying a Dockerized JavaScript and React.js App with a Database

Explore the `dockerized-react-js-app-db` directory and `.github/workflows/dockerized-react-js-app-db.yml` file to learn how to deploy a Dockerized JavaScript application with `React.js` on the frontend and a database backend using Render.com. The example includes a Dockerfile for containerization.

## Deploying a Dockerized TypeScript and React.js App with a Database

Explore the `dockerized-react-ts-app-db` directory and `.github/workflows/dockerized-react-ts-app-db.yml` file to learn how to deploy a Dockerized TypeScript application with `React.js` on the frontend and a database backend using Render.com. The example includes a Dockerfile for containerization.
